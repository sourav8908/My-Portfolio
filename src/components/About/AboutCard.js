            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Sourav Mohanty </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Bhubaneswar,Odisha,  India.</span>

            Currently pursuing my M.Tech at IIT Patna, where Iâ€™m honing advanced skills in backend development, data structures, and scalable system design.
            <br />
            I am a passionate programmer and a tech enthusiast. I love to learn
            new technologies and build projects on them. I am a quick learner
            and a good team player. I have a strong foundation in data
            structures and algorithms. I have a good understanding of
            object-oriented programming concepts. I have a good knowledge of
            web development and I have worked on various projects using
            technologies like Spring-Boot ,React, Node.js, and MySQL.
            <br />
